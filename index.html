<h2>"Meating" your Expectations for over 20 years!</h2>
	<p>Thank you for trusting Moore's Meat House to process your meat into tasty treats for over 20 years. It has been a pleasure to turn your deer into summer sausage, breakfast and italian sausage, snack sticks, jerky and lean cuts of meat for so many years. /p>

<h3>The History</h3>
	<p>Moore's Meat House was established in 2001. It all began in the garage as a way to save money when the children were young but were very interested in hunting. It was an annual process that included the entire family. However, Nick was truly was the brainchild behind all the recipes. As family and friends started to taste the delicious treats, the requests for processing became abundant.</p>

<h3>Today</h3>
	<p>Over the last 22 years, many upgrades in the processes and equipment have changed in order to meet the growing demand. Today, we process over a hundred deer each year in the fall and winter months.  We miss Zak and Raquel as helpers these days. They are now pursuing their own dreams in college.</p>
