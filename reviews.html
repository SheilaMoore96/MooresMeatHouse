<h2>Here's what our customers have to say about our products!</h2>
	
	<blockquote><p>"The Moore's have always treated our family right.  Their products are store quality, but exquisite taste.  My family highly recommends the jalepeno and cheese summer sausage!"</blockquote></p>
		<h4>~John Smith</h4>

	<blockquote><p>"We have been taking our deer to Moore's Meat House since they opened.  They always have great quality products.  We have never tasted deer that was this good coming back from any other meat locker.  They take the time to clean meat like I've never heard of before.  Two thumbs up!!"</blockquote></p>
		<h4>~Terry Brusher</h4>

	<blockquote><p>"The Moores have a true passion for the outdoors and it shows in how they handle your game.  They truly want you to feel like a friend when you stop by.  I love the family and their products."</blockquote></p>
